now I have tested batch data under a step of 6ns every biased MD iteration.

We choose 3 different temperatures(`320K, 360K, 340K`), 3 different distance restrains(`0, [4.5, 1, 8], [20, 6, 8]`).

I am updating the python files used to analyse the result, I also need a submit script.

the convergence of RiD is not very good. over 10 iterations are need for a piptide coil. So, our system is more complex, which needs more iter or  MD time.

Now, i wanna analysis the procedure below:
```
1. complete the tasks above.
2. draw the CV sampled and the FE plot using MCMC.

```
